## 🚀 Project Overview

**Sumaya** is a mobile application designed to [briefly describe app purpose, e.g., “enhance productivity by organizing tasks seamlessly”].  
The project aims to deliver a user-friendly, scalable, and visually appealing app across multiple platforms.

## 🛠 Methodologies Used

We adopted a **hybrid approach** combining **Waterfall** and **Agile** to leverage the strengths of both methodologies:

- **Waterfall**: For initial requirement gathering, system design, and project planning.  
- **Agile (Scrum)**: For development cycles, sprint planning, and iterative delivery.

- **Daily Stand-ups**: Quick check-ins to ensure progress and remove blockers.  
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflection sessions conducted at the end of each sprint to identify successes, challenges, and improvements for the next cycle.
